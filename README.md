# Text-to-Voice-Converter
The **Text-to-Voice Converter** is a simple web app that converts text into speech using JavaScript's **SpeechSynthesis API**. Users enter text, click a button, and hear it spoken aloud. It works on all modern browsers and supports future enhancements like multi-language support, speech rate adjustment, and voice recognition. ðŸš€
